# Dotfiles

These files are the configuration I use to personalise my computer and my
development environment.

I follow the conventions laid out by
[Substrate](//github.com/goodgravy/substrate) which means that running the
[`substrate`](/substrate/script/substrate) script links files into the right
places, sets up my path, and runs the `setup.sh` scripts.

A good amount of this configuration was inspired by or taken directly from
[holman/dotfiles](//github.com/holman/dotfiles).
